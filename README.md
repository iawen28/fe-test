##### Made Using create-react-app

I chose React because I wanted to brush up on my React skills and the Sketch file looked like it had a lot of components. However, the API needs more data to display dynamically. In addition to repeating images in the API, there are no women's products and not as many product colors as in the Sketch file.

##### Fully Responsive

I made sure that everything is visible at all screen widths, often sacrificing exact `px` values in the Sketch file for more responsive `vw` values.
